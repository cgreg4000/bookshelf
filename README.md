This project represents a virtual bookshelf that can be used to store books that someone may wish to read at some point or really for any books they would just like to keep track of. It is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). It features CRUD commands (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) as well as validations on the forms.
